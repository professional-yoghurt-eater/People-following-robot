People Following Robot
This repository is a guide to my People following robot project. This is a robot that detects, then follows a single person using their body heat.
To complete this project, one has to follow the setup provided by the schematic, and can inspire their final build with the final pictures I shared
One should then use the code I provided on an arduino uno, and let it run
I would like to mention the fact that the robot has an initialization time of about 30 seconds
This robot should not work if there are many people around it
It is relevant to say that one must build a side blinder for it to function properly. I made mine with an angle of 15 degrees.
